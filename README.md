# AI-CS-370

**Treasure hunt game:**
The TreasureHuntGame is an AI-based pathfinding game. First, the player must find the treasure in the game before the AI pirate agent does. Then, using a Q-learning algorithm, the pirate learns the best way to reach the treasure regardless of where he is on the map.

**Tools used:** 
Python's TensorFlow and Keras libraries are used to implement deep reinforcement learning and solve the pathfinding problem.

**Explination on AI:**
Artificial neural networks are used in machine learning. The project in question uses deep reinforcement learning with two neural networks. Markov decision processes involve states, actions, and rewards in reinforcement learning. The NNs, for example, predict future actions based on past actions which have granted certain rewards. The NNs determine which action offers the highest reward based on their processing of the environment. When the chosen action is performed, the NNs update their model weights to remember and improve.
While Q-learning NNs store all possible actions and states in a Q-table, deep Q-learning NNs do not. As a result, it uses an approximation function to generalize Q-values, resulting in a machine learning technique suitable for more complex environments with more possible actions.

**Addressing the the questions given in the CS 370 week 8 **
1. developed the code for reinforcement learning. By utilizing Keras and Tensorflow, I developed the pathfinding solution. In addition to GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, I received the setup code for the game.
2. Researchers use technology to solve complex problems in new ways. It is my job to think technically when solving problems. To solve problems efficiently, I use the resources provided in the class.
3. In this course, I learned that hidden bias in artificial intelligence is one of the most important ethical issues. Artificial intelligence can be biased and can harm society without us realizing it. Thus, as a machine learning developer, it is essential to be aware of my biases when designing systems.
